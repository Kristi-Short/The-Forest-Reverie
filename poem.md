â€™Tis said that when <br>
The hands of men<br>
Tamed this primeval wood,<br>
And hoary trees with groans of woe,<br>
Like warriors by an unknown foe,<br>
Were in their strength subdued,<br>
The virgin Earth<br>
Gave instant birth<br>
To springs that neâ€™er did flow<br>
That in the sun<br>
Did rivulets run,<br>
And all around rare flowers did blow<br>
The wild rose pale<br>
Perfumed the gale<br>
And the queenly lily adown the dale<br>
(Whom the sun and the dew<br>
And the winds did woo),<br>
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.<br>

So when in tears<br>
The love of years<br>
Is wasted like the snow,<br>
And the fine fibrils of its life<br>
By the rude wrong of instant strife<br>
Are broken at a blow<br>
Within the heart<br>
Do springs upstart<br>
Of which it doth now know,<br>
And strange, sweet dreams,<br>
Like silent streams<br>
That from new fountains overflow,<br>
With the earlier tide<br>
Of rivers glide<br>
Deep in the heart whose hope has died,<br>
Quenching the fires its ashes hide,<br>
Its ashes, whence will spring and grow<br>
Sweet flowers, ere long,<br>
The rare and radiant flowers of song!<br>
